I attempted to make the multiplayer version of this programming test. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the ball working properly for multiplayer, but I have completed the rest of the assignment rather sufficiently. Working with networking in unity for the first time in a long time and learning a new API proved more difficult than I initially expected.
